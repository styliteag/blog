ZFS (Zettabyte File System) is a powerful filesystem that combines the roles of a filesystem and volume manager. In this guide, we'll walk through the basics of setting up ZFS on Linux.

## Why ZFS?

ZFS offers several advantages:
- **Data integrity**: Built-in checksumming and self-healing
- **Snapshots**: Instant, space-efficient snapshots
- **Compression**: Built-in compression support
- **RAID-Z**: Software RAID with better performance than traditional RAID

## Installation

First, install the ZFS utilities:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install zfsutils-linux
```

## Creating Your First Pool

Create a simple pool with a single disk:

```bash
sudo zpool create mypool /dev/sdb
```

## Working with Datasets

Create a dataset:

```bash
sudo zfs create mypool/data
```

## Advanced Features

### Snapshots

Create a snapshot:

```bash
sudo zfs snapshot mypool/data@backup-2024-01-15
```

### Compression

Enable compression:

```bash
sudo zfs set compression=lz4 mypool/data
```

This is just the beginning of what you can do with ZFS. For more advanced configurations and enterprise solutions, check out our consulting services.
